            <h5>Vkart Private Limited, Vkart is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bengaluru, India.
                It was founded by Vinay Jawadwar in 2018. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding
                into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and
                lifestyle products.
                The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary,
                and the domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2020, Vkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce
                industry.
                Vkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its
                acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the
                sale of electronics and mobile phones.
                Vkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
                In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Vkart for US$16
                billion, valuing it at $20 billion.</h5>
